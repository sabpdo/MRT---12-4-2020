# PsychoPy-Mental_Rotation_Task

In my work with Dr. Chrastil's Spatial Navigation lab, I re-coded a spatial perspective taking task known as the Mental Rotation Task into PsychoPy (a commonly used 
platform for psychology experiments) using Python.

The Mental Rotation Task (MRT)  is a standard test of mental rotation. In the task, participants are presentted a target 3D drawing of an arrangementt of blocks, along with
four alternative drawings. Subjecs are asked to select the ttwo alternatives ha trepresened hte same arrangement of blocks as the target drawing, only rotated in position.
